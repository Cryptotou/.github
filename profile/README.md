Cryptotou is a GitHub organization developing **[Cryptorii](https://cryptorii.com)**, a cryptocurrency analysis platform providing insightful data and tools for market participants.
Our goal is to offer analysis comparable to platforms like Glassnode and IntoTheCryptoverse.

Our product names combine "Crypto" with Japanese words reflecting their function (e.g., _Torii_ for our main platform's gateway, _Totou_ for our organization).

The core development work for the **Cryptorii** application and its supporting components (**Cryptoukei** - data analysis, **Cryptokuhou** - news aggregation) is housed within **private repositories** within this organization.
